First respository project


I am a 23 year-old-mother of one beautiful 2-year-old. I love her so much. She is the main reason why I am learning coding. She has helped me to realize how valuable life is. She helps me get out of bed each morning. As time and energy consuming motherhood may be, it is the best thing that's happened to me. I don't see the world through a gray lense anymore. I am healing myself while creating a safe and stable space for my daughter. She will be proud of me, I just know it!
